  <b>HTML - <em>Hypertext Markup Language</b></em>
<p>HTML is made up of:<br>
- text content (what you see)<br>
- markup (what it looks like)<br>
- references to other documents (e.g. images & videos)<br><br>Coding is when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.

<br>Since computers are stupid, programmers need to write exactly the way a computer
understands (also known as writing in correct "syntax")
